# GoXLR Fader Sync Plugin
An OBS Studio Plugin that enables synchronizing the volume slider of an audio source with an audio channel from your GoXLR. 
This allows you to manage the volume of audio sources using the GoXLR's faders.

This plugin is essentially a port of the [goxlr-obs-fader-sync](https://github.com/FrostyCoolSlug/goxlr-obs-fader-sync) 
project developed by [FrostyCoolSlug](https://github.com/FrostyCoolSlug) into an OBS plugin.

If you need help or encounter any problems, feel free to join the [GoXLR Utility Discord](https://discord.gg/QtHQBwnfyW) 
or create a [new Issue](https://github.com/parzival-space/obs-goxlr-fader-sync-plugin/issues/new) in the Issues section.

## Requirements
* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) v30.0+
* [GoXLR Utility](https://github.com/GoXLR-on-Linux/goxlr-utility) v1.0.0+

Note: While the plugin may work with some older versions of OBS Studio and GoXLR Utility, 
it was tested and developed with the above versions in mind.

### Additional Requirements for Development
If you plan on contributing to this project, you will also need a working [.Net SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) 8.0+ installation as well as all
other .NET Native AOT requirements. 
You can find a detailed list and installation instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/?tabs=net8plus%2Cwindows#prerequisites).

The repository contains a build script for Windows and Linux in the scripts directory that will automatically build the 
project and install the plugin into your OBS directory.
